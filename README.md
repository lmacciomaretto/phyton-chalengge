# python-challenge

This repository contains all the files for Assignment #3.

It is composed by 2 folders that share the same structure, and by this README file.

Folder names are PyBank and PyPoll. Each of these contain the script for their respective data, named generically as main.py.

In addition to the script, they contain a folder named "Resources" which holds the csv file used for each analysis, and an "Analysis" folder containing a text document with the output of each code.
